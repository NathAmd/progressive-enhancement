    Je ne suis vraiment pas fan du html/css, je sais que je n'ai pas respecter toutes les consignes ou pas au bonne endroit,
    donc j'ai experimenter pour essayer de faire quelque chose de potable pour ma premiére fois afin de prendre plus de plaisir pour me familiariser avec ce code.

In nature, <strong  class="good">good</strong> & <strong class="bad">Evil</strong> do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <strong  class="good">good</strong> nor <strong class="bad">bad</strong>, but a potential in permanent

<p>
Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from
Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.
</p>
<p>
Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists
neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible
because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality
that much, everything’s fake.
</p>
<p>
They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip
and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively
do it anyway.

The story
</h2>
<section class="flex">
<article>
<blockquote>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said,
“Is it <strong  class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong  class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
The farmer again said, “Is it <strong  class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong  class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”
</p>
<p>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <strong  class="bad">bad</strong>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <strong  class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong  class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.” The
next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it <strong  class="good">good</strong>? Is it
<strong  class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”
</p>
<p>
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether
anything that happens in it is <strong  class="good">good</strong> or <strong  class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
you never know what will be the consequences of <strong  class="good">good</strong> fortune.

Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
<strong  class="good">good</strong> and <strong  class="bad">bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong  class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong  class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not
make a big deal out of it...
